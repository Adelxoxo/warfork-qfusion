:: :: Changes from 2019.08.17 to 2019.09.11

General:
- Updated placeholder sounds. Most of the sounds were converted from stereo into mono to make them work correctly in 3D space. Also their volumes were adjusted and normalized in order to avoid clipping and make them more balanced to each other. Some sounds were reworked and swapped to make more the sense. And last but not least, hitsounds are now variable depending on the damage.
