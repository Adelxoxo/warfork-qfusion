Notes on Framework update process.

Frameworks are build using libraries from libsrc subdirectory of top-level directory.
Please specify the oldest possible OSX SDK (for XCode 6.0 it is v. 9), standard architecture - 
64-bit Intel.

Individual notes:

1. libRocket. To build libRocket use cmake:
  $ cd libsrcs/libRocket/libRocket/Build/
  $ cmake -G Xcode -DBUILD_FRAMEWORK=1 -DBUILD_ROCKET_8BPP_FONTS=1 -DCMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH=../../../../source/mac/Frameworks/ .
  $ xcodebuild -target Rocket -configuration Release ARCHS=x86_64 ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO

  After build, you need to substitute old Rocket.framework with new one (from the same directory):
  $ rm -rf ../../../../source/mac/Frameworks/Rocket.framework/
  $ mv Release/Rocket.framework/ ../../../../source/mac/Frameworks/

  Don't forget "git add --all".

  Current libRocket was built using sources with 8bpp fonts support from GitHub/Warsow/libRocket,
  commit f4f4808e5474c9354b8746c5021c5d5bc5e14b61 (Merge branch '8bpp_fonts' by viciious; Jan 21, 2015).
